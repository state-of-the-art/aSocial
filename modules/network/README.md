aSocial Network module
======================

Manages connections and do low-level networking tasks.

Transport
---------
I think it is possible to use a number of transports (like tox, retroshare etc.) to be able to talk to different clients - not only asocial.co

Support:
--------
If you like low-level connections, you can support our open-source development by a small Bitcoin donation.
